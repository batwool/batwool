Hi there! I'm Lyza or Siamese, or @batwool.
I'm currently a beginner learning to code,
Im a second year CS student. I want to learn more
and talk to people with similar interests. 
One day I'd like to build something of my own,
for now I want to gain experience and collaborate 
with people.

Thank you for visiting my page!
